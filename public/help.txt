Welcome to the Treq API Playground!
This file is served over HTTP.
Anyone can access it.

There are four flags hidden somewhere in this website. 
Find them all and submit them to /submit.html to reveal the secret.


This exercise shows how credentials sent over HTTP can be intercepted, while HTTPS keeps them protected.

### 1. Install mitmproxy
- Recommended: use Python â‰¥ 3.7
- Run:
  pip install mitmproxy

### 2. Start mitmproxy in proxy mode 
- Run:
  mitmproxy --mode regular --listen-port 8080

3. Curl to see the difference
- curl -x http://localhost:8080 http://<your-ip>/files/credentials.txt
- curl -x https://localhost:8080 http://<your-ip>/files/credentials.txt

*curl -x sets up the proxy temporarily.
